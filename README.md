# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the SoC Tapeout Program VSD!

This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks inside each week.

* RTL Design → Synthesis → Physical Design → Tapeout Ready





| Day  | Topics Covered | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Day 0** | [**Tools Installation**](Day0/README.md) | **✅ Done** |




# 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0

This week was all about setting up my environment and getting familiar with the tools I’ll be using throughout the program. Here’s what I accomplished:

Successfully installed and verified all the essential open-source EDA tools.

Learned how to set up a development environment for RTL design and synthesis.

Prepared my system to be fully ready for upcoming experiments in the RTL → GDSII flow.

Gained confidence in handling tool installations and troubleshooting minor issues along the way.

# 🙏 Acknowledgments

I’m grateful to Kunal Ghosh and the entire VLSI System Design (VSD) team for giving me the opportunity to participate in the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.

I also want to acknowledge the support of RISC-V International, India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), VLSI Society of India (VSI), and Efabless for making this initiative possible and accessible to students like me.
