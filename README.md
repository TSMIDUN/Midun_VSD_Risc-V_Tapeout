# üåü Key Learnings Untill Now

This week was all about setting up my environment and getting familiar with the tools I‚Äôll be using throughout the program. Here‚Äôs what I accomplished:

Successfully installed and verified all the essential open-source EDA tools.

Learned how to set up a development environment for RTL design and synthesis.

Prepared my system to be fully ready for upcoming experiments in the RTL ‚Üí GDSII flow.

Gained confidence in handling tool installations and troubleshooting minor issues along the way.

# üôè Acknowledgments

I‚Äôm grateful to Kunal Ghosh and the entire VLSI System Design (VSD) team for giving me the opportunity to participate in the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.

I also want to acknowledge the support of RISC-V International, India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), VLSI Society of India (VSI), and Efabless for making this initiative possible and accessible to students like me.
